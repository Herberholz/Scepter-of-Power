# Scepter-of-Power

This ongoing personal project is a text-based RPG game. My inspiration for creating this game is to be able to develop a game where character stats alter how well a character does during combat sequences. This combined with a trained combat AI will make engagements exciting and unpredictable. The story and setting of scepter of power was created by my friend Joaquin Horta. As progress continues I would like to eventually transfer the combat mechanics into a 2D environment.
